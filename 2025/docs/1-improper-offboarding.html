<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Improper offboarding refers to the inadequate deactivation or removal of non-human identities (NHIs) such as service accounts and access keys when they are no longer needed. This situation often arises when applications are deprecated, services are taken offline, or when the original owners or administrators of these NHIs leave the organization. Failure to properly offboard NHIs poses significant security risks. Unmonitored and deprecated services may remain vulnerable, and their associated NHIs can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data. Additionally, orphaned NHIs may retain elevated permissions, amplifying the potential damage from any security breach.</p>

<h2 id="example-attack-scenarios">Example Attack Scenarios</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Orphaned Kubernetes Service Accounts:</strong> A Kubernetes cluster belonging to a decommissioned service retains active service accounts. If an attacker gains access to this unmonitored cluster, they could exploit these service accounts to interact with other resources within the organization’s infrastructure, potentially leading to data exfiltration or further compromise.</li>
  <li><strong>Ex-Employee Exploiting Unrevoked Credentials:</strong> An employee who managed automated services leaves the organization, but the NHIs associated with those services are not disabled or transferred. The ex-employee could misuse still-valid credentials to access the organization’s systems remotely, leading to unauthorized data access, service disruptions, or even sabotage.</li>
  <li><strong>Leftover Apps Used for Privilege Escalation &amp; Lateral Movement:</strong> An application created in a test environment, designated to test a workload, is later connected to a sensitive production environment to complete the testing suite, and is not decommissioned once the workload is transferred to run in a production server. Then, an attack reaching the less secure test environment can use this application to move laterally within the organization.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-prevent">How to Prevent</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Implement an offboarding process that reviews all NHIs associated with the departing employee. For each NHI, determine if it is still required. If not, decommission it; otherwise, transfer ownership to another employee and rotate any credentials the departing employee may have had access to during its creation.</li>
  <li>Automate offboarding steps wherever possible by integrating HR systems with identity and access management (IAM) tools.</li>
  <li>Regularly audit active NHIs to identify ongoing human usage and block potential misuse.</li>
