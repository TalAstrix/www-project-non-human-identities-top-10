Considering the case of an inside threat, it\u2019s quite simple to identify what necessary credentials are needed to exploit the improperly offboarded identity. The current capabilities of offboarding NHIs, such as service accounts, are lackluster, and organizations rarely use existing possibilities. Thus, many NHIs are not properly offboarded after they are no longer needed or once the original owner has left.Security teams are lacking tools to detect old NHIs that were not properly offboarded. Existing techniques of detecting such NHIs rely on incomplete information that takes a long time to compile. Due to the deep insight a potential inside threat has of the organization, exploiting improperly offboarded NHIs could lead to compromise of critical systems, exfiltration of sensitive data and usage of advanced persistence methods."},{"location":"1-improper-offboarding/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>Improper offboarding refers to the inadequate deactivation or removal of non-human identities (NHIs) such as service accounts and access keys when they are no longer needed. This situation often arises when applications are deprecated, services are taken offline, or when the original owners or administrators of these NHIs leave the organization. Failure to properly offboard NHIs poses significant security risks. Unmonitored and deprecated services may remain vulnerable, and their associated NHIs can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.

After gaining access to a non-production Microsoft 365 test tenant, they exploited a legacy OAuth application \u2014 an unmanaged non-human identity \u2014 with full privileges to access Microsoft's production environment. This led to unauthorized access to corporate email accounts, resulting in the exfiltration of sensitive communications and documents. </li> <li>Okta's Support System Breach (November 2023): Okta has experienced a security breach involving a compromised service account. An employee had saved the credentials for this service account to their personal Google account after signing in on an Okta-managed device. The compromise of the employee's personal Google account allowed attackers to obtain these credentials, granting unauthorized access to Okta's customer support system. The attackers accessed files related to 134 customers, including HTTP Archive (HAR) files containing sensitive data like session tokens.</li> <li>Internet Archive's Zendesk Support Platform Breach (October 2024): Attackers exploited unrotated access tokens tied to the Internet Archive's Zendesk support platform, leading to unauthorized access and potential data exposure.
