Considering the case of an inside threat, it\u2019s quite simple to identify what necessary credentials are needed to exploit the improperly offboarded identity. The current capabilities of offboarding NHIs, such as service accounts, are lackluster, and organizations rarely use existing possibilities. Thus, many NHIs are not properly offboarded after they are no longer needed or once the original owner has left.Security teams are lacking tools to detect old NHIs that were not properly offboarded. Existing techniques of detecting such NHIs rely on incomplete information that takes a long time to compile. Due to the deep insight a potential inside threat has of the organization, exploiting improperly offboarded NHIs could lead to compromise of critical systems, exfiltration of sensitive data and usage of advanced persistence methods."},{"location":"1-improper-offboarding/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>Improper offboarding refers to the inadequate deactivation or removal of non-human identities (NHIs) such as service accounts and access keys when they are no longer needed. This situation often arises when applications are deprecated, services are taken offline, or when the original owners or administrators of these NHIs leave the organization. Failure to properly offboard NHIs poses significant security risks. Unmonitored and deprecated services may remain vulnerable, and their associated NHIs can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data. Additionally, orphaned NHIs may retain elevated permissions, amplifying the potential damage from any security breach.</p>"},{"location":"1-improper-offboarding/#example-attack-scenarios","title":"Example Attack Scenarios","text":"<ul> <li>Orphaned Kubernetes Service Accounts: A Kubernetes cluster belonging to a decommissioned service retains active service accounts.
